INSTRUCTIONS:

1)PERFORM DATA CLEANING (FOR EACH COLUMN: INDICATE IF DROPING
OR KEEPING AND WHY,  FOR THE ONES KEEPING PERFORM SOME CLEANING
OF THE MISSING VALUES OR JUSTIFY WHEN THAT IS NOT NECESSARY),  
2)DATA PREPARATION (FOR EACH COLUMN PERFORM 
A TRANSFORMATION- FOR EXAMPLE: TIME CALCULATION LIKE AGE, DAYS
AS CUSTOMERS,  DAYS TO DUE DATE, LABEL ENCODING, IMPUTATION, 
STANDARD SCALLING, DUMMY CREATION OR REPLACEMENT OF 
CATEGORY VALUE BY ITS PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT DEPENDING, JUSTIFY 
TRANSFORMATION DEPENDING OF THE VARIABLE TYPE, OR EXPLAIN WHY
TRANSFORMATION IS NOT NECESSARY) ALWAYS HAVING IN MIND THAT: 
THE OBJECTIVE IS TO PERFORM A LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL USING
BUCKET BINNED (BUCKET 0 AND ALL OTHER BUCKET CATEGORIES AS 1)
AS OUR TARGET AND THEN TRAIN A LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL TO USE 
AS A BASELINE.  NO NEED TO IMPROVE THE MODEL, FOCUS ON DOING A GOOD DATA CLEANING.
